+ log all commands as they come and go
+ Report device in the logged IOs
+ Create a rolling snapshot of IO latencies
- Provide a method to pull the IO latencies snapshot (for debugging based on an external event)
- Send the snapshot upon an event
  - sense key is an error
  - latency above a threshold
+ Attach to all SCSI hosts
- Rescan SCSI hosts (preferably on creation)
c Handle SCSI host deletion properly
- Find IO abnormalities with IOs that never completed (host disppeared? we never were notified of completion?)
- Create histogram of IO latencies periodically per device
- Make it all lockless to reduce impact on system performance and per-IO overhead
- Sniff error handling
- Use error handling as exception that triggers a snapshot
